    <h1 id="mainTitle">Why does this site exist?</h1>
    <p id="aboutContent">
      I have created this site for various reasons, the primary being my final year project.
      As part of my initial project journey, ideas were something I struggled with.
      This idea came to mind as a means to combat future students feeling stuck for ideas or inspiration for their projects. 
      I also felt it could useful for students to document their trials and tribulations as they move through their own project development. 
      These issues being documented somewhere may allow future students to learn and build on past students mistakes.
      This in turn should improve the quality of projects produced year on year by final year students.
