Testing Post for NLP Classification

"This is my first project post. My project is a social media platform that consists of a Laravel backend as an API, serving a static Vue JS frontend. This is routed using a custom configured Nginx webserver, backed with a PostgreSQL database. Caching is done using Redis. I have deployed this using Kubernetes onto Google Kubernetes Engine. I have also implemented Natural Language Processing using the Google NLP API, leveraging a combination of content classification, and entity analysis."
